# Concept2 Data

## Overview

In an effort to actually keep a New Years Resolution (Spoiler Alert: It didnâ€™t work!) to actually use our rowing machine, I wrote this Django app to my husband and I keep track of distance rowed and to turn it into a fun competition.

Data is supplied by web-scraping our online Concept2 logbooks and served, with a twist, from this Django-backed app.
